In this modification I add the scrolView Feature in the signup page:

I wrapped the entire content inside a ScrollView to make it scrollable.
Added a KeyboardAvoidingView to handle the keyboard behavior,
which is necessary for a better user experience on iOS devices. The behavior is set to
"padding" for iOS and "height" for Android.
